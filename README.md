# Internal DSL
 An internal DSL creating web pages in HTML format.
 The Model.java file can be used (run) to create html files from the specified model in the Main method, each page() tag specifies a new web page, and thus will be saved seperately in the files directory.
 Opening the files directory after running the Main method in the Model class will reveal a set of pages using the commonly specified navigation bar. Double-click any of the pages to open them in your prefered browser.
